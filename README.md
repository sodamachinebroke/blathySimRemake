Remake of an old game a friend made


### Description
The basic idea is that you're a nicotine addicted high schooler, who is on a break, making their way outside. There are a number of teachers in school, who your character meets inevitably, along with different other people. You have 3 choices regarding your actions:
1. Ask for cigs
2. Cooperate with partners
3. Flee the scene

There a number of possible random interactions, including ones where you die.
The goal of the game is to get outside, either by getting *x* amount of cigarettes, or simply by having a number of interactions. I mean you cannot simply interact with let's say sixty people and not manage to outside.
If you run out of cigarettes, you die. If you make a bad choice with teachers, you die. If you have too many interactions without going outside, break is over, you lose and therefore die.


### Current achievements
So far, it has a functioning Main Menu, Death screen, HUD and the program can identify the type of interaction with a partner.

### Current Goals and Roadmap
First and foremost a Win screen needs to be implemented.
Make the game playable. Implement the basic gameplay loop of interacting with people. Certain interactions need to change the stats.
Make it look good, pleasing to the eye. Or not, but that will be on purpose.
Need the difficulty options the original had and need the character options.
Lastly achievements.
